# hamHelper

*Coming soon*

**Installation**
`pip install hamhelper`

**Purpose**

This package contains a set of helper functions and methods I use. Primarily geared towards physics, experimental analysis, and data visualization. The goal is to simplify common procedures around generating pretty plots Mitch minimal chart-junk as well as getting the values that matter (ie. curve fit routine that also computes common values of merrit).

**Extra: Colours**

Further this package hosts a suite of colour maps and themes for scientific use and consistent design practices. Colour maps are borrowed from sources listed below and my own design. Methods are included for comparing, visualizing, and testing colour combinations. The code is based on matplotlib and geared towards their environment.
